    "\n",
    "Answers:\n",
    "1. LongFormer's returned articles are MUCH better at Anecdotal Semantic Similarity (what gets returned is actually reasonably relevant)\n",
    "  - If Specificity isn't what we are after, they both do reasonably well on general similarity (Wiki pages for Unsupervised/Supervised learning return the counterpart)\n",
    "2. For Computation Speed MiniLM is much faster for computing embeddings for the same amount of text (omitted the time required for the averaging operation but it doesn't add too much)\n",
    "3. Distributional Stuff\n",
    "   - Longformer's computed similarities are all very high, roughly all sims are >.95\n",
    "   - MiniLM's similarities have a wider distribution (-.1 < .50) but nothing is flagged as being \"very similar\" \n",
    "   - What seems to be on display here is a tradeoff between variance and bias, LongFormer is biased towards everything being similar but is still accurate (if we account for bias, i.e. take the few highest values) and MiniLM is variant, having a larger breadth of values but not being accurate in the way we want\n",

       "   '- The keyboard is easier to get used to on a Mac than a PC',\n",
