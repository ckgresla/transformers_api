When people browse\nthe web, which is one important behavior common in modern lives,\ngoals also underlie why they do what they do. For example, they\nmay buy products to work towards their fitness goals, plan trips to\nstay connected with friends and family, conduct business to pursue career success, or do research or seek health advice in support\nof their well-being. Understanding peoples’ goals not only helps\nanswer the “why” questions about their activities [18, 56], but also\nsignifies where the opportunities sit for potential improvements.\nAlthough goals and motives are fundamental to browsing behaviors, they stay unobserved and cannot be easily inferred due to\nthe variety and complexity of activities prevalent on modern web\nbrowsers. Moreover, the question of how goals and motives can\nbe utilized to assist browsing remains unanswered. To bridge the\ngap, we propose to adopt the well-established bodies of psychological theories [5, 11, 44] regarding human motives to the need\nfor browser-centric activities. For instance, the motive of staying\nphysically healthy may energize a person to consider purchasing\na rowing machine or to learn nutritious ingredients via a number\nof web interactions. As a result, a better understanding of human\nmotives can guide how we might enhance browsing experiences\npertaining to people’s needs.\nPrevious research on supporting user goals on the web has primarily sought to understand and categorize a person’s intent manifested through search queries. In their seminal studies, Broder [8]\nand Rose and Levinson [54] classified the goal of a user query into\none of three categories: navigational, informational, and transactional. Successive work refined intent categorization by introducing\npurchase, sell or job search intents [14, 36], as well as examined the\nvariability of intents across different users [62]. The main objective\nof research in this field is often to inform and improve the search\nprocess [8, 9, 35, 54], and the characteristics of user goals tend to be\ntask-oriented or situation-specific. In contrast to that, we emphasize incorporating the fundamental human goals into the context\nof web browsing, since they are recognized to be key to the core\n1\narXiv:2108.03350v1 [cs.IR] 7 Aug 2021\nRecSys ’21, September 27-October 1, 2021, Amsterdam, Netherlands J.-Y. Jiang et al.\nvalues in people’s lives [5] (e.g. health, well-being, sustainability,\nand learning).\nIn this paper, we focus on tackling two research agendas toward our goal-directed vision, namely, how to represent influential\nhuman goals1\nand how to leverage the learned representations\nto provide assistance in browsing sessions. We propose a unified\nneural framework, Goal-directed Web Browsing (GoWeB), for both\nobjectives laid out in two phases. The first phase concerns human\nmotives. Psychology research has developed decades of knowledge\ninforming which human goals are considered influential through\ntheoretical and empirical evidence. Inspired by the findings, GoWeB\nuses these goals as the backbone and builds on the top to learn\nintrinsic goal representations following a distance-based reconstruction objective to retain inherent hierarchical structures2\n. GoWeB\nfurther devises a neural goal estimator, which learns to transfer\nthe knowledge entailed in these goal representations to estimating\npeople’s motives for visiting web pages. The second phase focuses\non enhancing web experiences with what we have learned. Specifically, GoWeB integrates the goal estimator with modern language\nmodels [15] to assist three common interactions or needs people\nhave on the web. We consider an in-session web page recommender\nthat recommends web pages to help people advance their goals, a\nweb page re-visitation classifier that predicts if a person will revisit\na web page in the future due to recurring or unfinished goals, and\na web page grouping method that clusters in-session web pages\naccording to underlying goals. The overall framework is illustrated\nin Figure 4.\nWe evaluate GoWeB using anonymized browsing logs obtained\nfrom the Microsoft Edge browser. The experimental results show\nthat GoWeB consistently outperforms competitive baselines in all\nthree browser-centric applications, suggesting that capturing fundamental human motives can empirically improve the intelligence\nof web browsers. To understand the effectiveness, we find that the\nlearned intrinsic goal representations largely preserve the humancurated hierarchical relations. Meanwhile, the goal estimator can\neffectively predict the goals behind web page visits evaluated based\non quantitative and qualitative exercises. Our follow-up analysis\nfurther characterizes the browsing patterns when people engage\nin pursuing different goals. The results suggest that people may\nexplore multiple directions simultaneously when the categories of\nsession’s focal goals are broad (e.g., Ethics & Idealism), while they\nmay revisit web resources in shorter intervals for goals concerning\nsocial interactions (e.g., Friendship).\n2 Related Work\nStudying goals is an important, long-lasting topic across multiple\nresearch disciplines. We examine the different notions of goals that\nhave been investigated in the literature.\nTask-oriented Goals in Search and Web Browsing. Prior work\nhas a strong focus on studying search goals as they contribute to\na critical segment of web browser usage. The mainstream work\nin this space follows Broder [8], and Rose and Levinson [54] who\nclassified the goal of user queries into navigational, informational,\n1Unless otherwise mentioned, we use human motives and goals interchangeably in\nthis paper.\n2\nFor example, in Chulef et al. [11]’s human goal taxonomy, the goals be affectionate\nand share feelings are both decedents of a parent goal friendship.\nand/or transactional. Lee et al. [35] identified that 60% of search\nqueries can be associated with informational or navigational goals,\nand proposed using clicks and anchors to predict those. Caruccio\net al. [9] introduced a lightweight taxonomy that added a handful\nof sub-classes to informational and transactional queries. Casting\nas a classification problem, they proposed content and behavioral\nfeatures to predict which class in the taxonomy a query should\nbelong to using data collected from a custom browser extension.\nFor more complex search needs, Jones and Klinkner [26] leveraged\nhuman annotations and built predictive models that were trained\nto segment sequences of user queries into same or different search\ngoals. Among a set of hand-crafted features, they showed that\nlexical features such as words and characters were identified as the\nmost useful. Similarly, Law and Zhang [32] showed that the ability\nto decompose a complex search goal into sub-problems (i.e., a set\nof queries and corresponding search results) can better support a\nuser’s information need.\nGeneral web browsing behavioral patterns tend to involve higher\nflexibility and complexity than search. Kumar and Tomkins [31]\nanalyzed large-scale commercial logs and showed that page visits\nrelated to search comprise only one-sixth of the log sample. In addition to search, they identified that content consumption (e.g., news,\nportals, games, verticals, multimedia) comprise about half of online\npage views, while communication (e.g., email, social networking,\nforums, blogs, chat) represent about one-third of those. As a result,\ngeneral web browsing patterns require different types of support.\nFor example, past studies have shown that people are often unable\nto focus on or return to their goals when using a web browser due\nto the prevalence of distractions on the web [1, 63]. Research on\nCyberloafing [20, 37] and task resumption on the web [19, 43, 48]\nhave shown that individuals experience difficulty when resuming\ntheir main task after external- or self-interruptions [3, 13].\nFaaborg and Lieberman [18] introduced a program-by-example\ngoal-oriented web browser that allows people to customize how\nthey organize and interact with the web. A person who visits a\nrecipe website, for example, may want to know the nutritional\ninformation. By explicitly demonstrating how to complete nutrition extraction once, the system could potentially evoke the same\nhuman-specified macros on similar websites. Dix et al. [16] attempted to understand the goals behind user behavior by connecting actions and user-created personal ontology structures.\nHigher-ordered Human Goals. Understanding human goals and\nmotives has long been a central area of research in the psychology\nliterature, as the goals of individuals largely direct the behavior\nin which they engage [29]. Earlier attempts in creating goal taxonomies relied on theoretical viewpoints. McDougall [42] presented\na list of 13 instincts while Murray [45] articulated 44 variables\nof personality as forces determining behavior. Chulef et al. [11]\ntook an empirical approach and recruited participants of diverse\nbackgrounds to delve into developing a hierarchical human goal\ntaxonomy based on similarity between goals, providing a concrete\nand comprehensive structure. More recently, Talevich et al. [60]\niterated on the taxonomy derived in "
