        "SUMMARY": [
            "- the HHKB Professional Hybrid is the first HHKB to offer USB-C and Bluetooth hybrid functionality",
            "- The HHKB was first introduced in December 1996 by PFU Fujitsu",
            "- The keyboard was designed to be a standardized keyboard layout for all computers",
            "- The current generation of the HHKB is the Pro 3",
            "- The HHKB operates using an array of rubber domes and conical springs resting atop the PCB",
            "- Each keycap mounts to a plastic slider/plunger",
            "- Unlike traditional mechanical switches, the HHKB uses a capacitive switch",
            "- The keyboard has a unique typing feel and sound",
            "- The HHKB keyboard is one of the most well-proportioned and visually appealing keyboard layouts on the market",
            "- The keyboard comes in white or charcoal and can be ordered in a variety of colors",
            "- It has the potential to be an iconic modern design like the Leica M and VW Beetle",
            "- Fujitsu's Pro 2 and Pro 3 keyboards have different contoured profiles",
            "- The top side of the Pro 3 is about 1mm taller than the Pro 2",
            "- The Pro 3 Hybrid has a cylindrical hump on the top side to house two AA batteries for wireless functionality",
            "- HHKB Pro 3 keycaps are made of dye-sublimated PBT and have a mildly textured finish",
            "- The contour of the keycaps is very similar to that of the Cherry profile",
            "- The Pro 3 now uses a PBT spacebar instead of the previous ABS one",
            "- topre domes have a nice, snappy tactile feedback unlike any MX-style switch",
            "- worn-in domes on the Pro 2 feel more tactile and snappy than the new ones in the HHKB Hybrid",
            "- Topre has a nice subtlety to it that allows you to focus on typing",
            "- The HHKB Hybrid produces a harsh, chattering typing sound due to the all-plastic construction",
            "- You can modify the keyboard to improve the sound by installing silencing rings, lubing the housing rails, and inserting dampening material in the hollow areas of the case",
            "- The HHKB's layout is a deviation from a standard ANSI 60% keyboard",
            "- The keyboard is easier to get used to on a Mac than a PC",
            "- The keys are mapped differently from other 60% keyboards",
            "- The Topre switches are the other major selling point of the HHKB",
            "- The HHKB connects with up to four devices over Bluetooth with no latency issues",
            "- The keyboard has a three-month battery life on two AAs",
            "- The volume up/down keys only work when connected via Bluetooth and not USB-C",
            "- The HHKB is a compact and lightweight Bluetooth keyboard",
            "- there are three versions of the HHKB available",
            "- the Professional Classic, Hybrid, and Hybrid Type-S are all factory silenced",
            "- Norbauer's Heavy Grail allows you to retrofit your own HHKB with a variety of aftermarket options",

        "SUMMARY": [
            "- This chapter introduces a reinforcement learning method called Temporal-Difference (TD) learning",
            "- TD learning is an unsupervised technique in which the learning agent learns to predict the expected value of a variable at the end of a sequence of states",
            "- RL allows the learned state-values to guide actions to change the environment",
            "- supervised learning is a general approach to predicting the weather on Saturday",
            "- Sutton (1988) shows how to train a network to predict the weather in the week leading up to it",
            "- Sutton says the actual weather conditions on each day of the week are relevant to predicting Saturday's weather",
            "- unsupervised learning tries to use intermediate information to learn to predict the weather",
            "- The method is different from the pairwise method of learning on observation-outcome pairs",
            "- Sutton says the unsupervised approach is based on the idea that predictions are not confirmed all at once but bit by bit",
            "- we will focus on the method of Temporal-Difference (TD) learning for unsupervised learning in prediction problems",
            "- In connectionist applications, the predicting function is realized in a neural network",
            "- The principles we will explore can be implemented by methods other than neural networks",
            "- The general supervised learning paradigm can be summarized in a familiar formula",
            "- Back propagation is the same computation that underlies back propagation",
            "- we use weights in the network to calculate the gradient of the learning rate constant in a sequence of steps",
            "-   ",
            "- where m is the number of steps in the sequence and z is the error of predictions on adjacent time steps",
            "- TD learning can be used to represent the error in terms of the sum of changes in predictions on previous steps",
            "-    in TD learning, the error is called z - V",
            "- sequence update rule is a weight update rule for a single time step",
            "- The rule can be derived from the sequence update formula for weight changes",
            "- The weight rule is the sum of differences and differences for the error in the formula",
            "-   the weight rule has a formula for the weight change",
            "- we need two successive predictions to form the error term",
            "- learning is occuring retroactively for already visited states",
            "- the update rule updates all previous predictions to make each closer to prediction V for the current state",
            "- Temporal-Difference learning is the name of this type of learning",
            "- this is a generalization of the TD(1) method",
            "- it produces weight changes that supervised methods cannot produce",
            "- it allows weight updates to occur incrementally over a sequence",
            "- Sutton (1988) developed the generalization to TD(\u03bb) in 1988",
            "- We have added a constant, \u03bb,  which exponentially discounts past gradients",
            "-   the gradient of a prediction occurring n steps in the past is weighted by ",

            "- Schoenberg:   his work was published in relative obscurity until 1853",

            "- The world is a combination of the Kantian and the human will in itself, he argues",
            "- Schopenhauer\u2019s metaphysics and philosophy of nature led him to the doctrine of pessimism",
            "- He held that sentient beings suffer as virtual slaves to their will to life",
            "- The philosopher's view of nature was a proto-Darwinian theory of nature",
            "- Schopenhauer sees a salutary role for the intellect in human life",
            "- He identifies three main ways in which the intellect breaks free from the will to life",
            "- These include aesthetic experience and artistic production, compassionate attitudes and actions, and ascetic resignation from embodied existence",
            "- Schopenhauer praises Kant for deepening the subjective turn in philosophical aesthetics",
            "- He says that the phenomenon of beauty can only be illuminated through a careful scrutiny of its effects on the subject",
            "- He argues that Kant's aesthetic method is too indirect due to the transcendental argument",
            "- Schopenhauer does not believe that the aesthetician should start from aesthetic judgment but from immediate aesthetic experience",
            "- He argues that there is non-conceptual knowledge that we gain through aesthetic experiences of nature and art",
            "- Schopenhauer says this knowledge is not conceptual, but rather intuitive",
            "- Schopenhauer argues that Kant's aesthetic judgment is at one remove from true aesthetic experience",
